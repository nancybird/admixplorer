Description: This package takes admixture date estimates and their
    standard deviations from individuals (which can have variable sampling
    ages, in e.g. ancient individuals) and clusters them with MCMC to
    determine the number of distinct admixture pulses. It can also
    re-estimate ancient individuals sampling ages based on the shared
    admixture date. Overall it borrows power to improve your joint date
    estimate.
